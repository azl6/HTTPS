# Questions

1. How widely is CloudFlare used?
2. Does the usage of SSL certificates imply on the usage of some sort of reverse-proxy?

# Symmetric and asymmetric algorithms

AES: Simetric, like AES256 used for SSE-S3. **Same key to encrypt and decrypt**.

RSA: Asymmetric, like SSH keys generated by `ssg-keygen -t rsa`. **Different keys to encrypt and decrypt**.

# Gerando hash com o SHA-256

Usei a flag `-a 256` para especificar o SHA-256. Podemos alterar essa flag para selecionar o algorítmo adequado.

```bash
echo "Hello world!" > file.txt
shasum -a 256 file.txt 
0ba904eae8773b70c75333db4de2f3ac45a8ad4ddba1b242f0b3cfc199391dd8  file.txt ####### Hash gerado pelo algorítmo
``` 

# Using OpenSSL

The following command generates a RSA key

```bash
openssl genrsa
```

To encrypt it, we can use the flag `-aes256`

```bash
openssl genrsa -aes256
```

To save the private-key to a file, we use the `-out` flag

```bash
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out myoutfile.txt
```

When we generate a RSA key with openssl, the public-key comes "mixed" with it. To extract the public-key, we use the following command:

```bash
openssl rsa -in <RSAOUTFILEFROMLASTCOMMAND> -outform PEM -pubout -out <PUBLICKEYNAME>
```

We can also generate different sizes of keys, like

```bash
openssl genrsa 4096
```

# How does the browser trust certain certificates

The OS comes "packed" with the root certificates installed. 

That means, if the certificate provided by the website matches the OS-downloaded root-certificate, a HTTPS connection will be successfully established

This is possible because intermediate-certificates are signed by the root-certificates, and the intermediate-certificates sign the end-user certificate

# Establishing a TLS connection

Cyper suites are information about the algorithms that will be used in that particular session, like AES-128 for encryption and SHA-256 for hashing

# Configuring NGINX on Ubuntu

Let's follow this tutorial: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04

Explanation of some aspects of the configuration:

This configuration consists in creating the `/var/www/your_domain/html/index.html` structure, changing `your_domain` for our created domain, aka alexthedeveloper.com.br. The `index.html` file at the end of the address contains the content that we want to serve.

After that, we create the `your_domain` file (aka alexthedeveloper.com.br) in the following folder: `/etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain`. This is where we will describe our routing strategies for Nginx to follow:

```bash
server {
        listen 80; ########## Listening port for IPV4
        listen [::]:80; ##### Listening port for IPV6

        root /var/www/alexthedeveloper.com.br/html; ### Place the client will be redirected to when entering the address in the server_name field
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name alexthedeveloper.com.br www.alexthedeveloper.com.br; ### Adresses that will redirect to the root file

        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}
```

After that, we just normally follow the tutorial.

# Installing certificates issued by CloudFlare on NGINX 

If we're using CloudFlare, we can go to the **SSL/TLS > Origin Server > Create Certificate** option

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80921933/223791933-17389882-8052-40d2-ae69-311f90754d33.png)

As the options, we can leave:

- RSA (2048)
- The default domains (*.domain.com, domain.com)
- 15 years 

As a result, the screen will show the generated **Origin Certificate** and **Private-Key**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80921933/223792847-6972c94d-5dd0-45bb-9661-ab6ebdaca8f3.png)

The end of the screen has a tutorial to install the certificates on different reverse-proxies

After clicking on it, we can choose the `NGINX` option

Since we already have the private-key and certificate generated by CloudFlare, we can jump to step **II.4 - Edit the Nginx virtual hosts file**

In a nutshell, this step simply tells us to create the `/etc/ssl/your_domain_name.pem` and `/etc/ssl/your_domain_name.key` files, and add the following lines to our `/etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain` file:

```
server {
        # ...
        listen   443;

        ssl    on;
        ssl_certificate    /etc/ssl/your_domain_name.pem; (or bundle.crt)
        ssl_certificate_key    /etc/ssl/your_domain_name.key;
        # ...

}
```
